#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

---How many orders were placed in January?---

SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6

---How many of those orders were for an iPhone?---

SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND product = 'iPhone';
 
---Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.---

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

---Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?---

SELECT DISTINCT Product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales); 

---What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?---

SELECT DISTINCT SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue, product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product <> 'Product'
AND Product <> ''
GROUP BY Product;

---Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?---

SELECT Product, Quantity, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales

---How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?---
